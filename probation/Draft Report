## Overview  
Universities, to ensure all students meet a minimum academic standard, implement a minimum Grade Point Average (GPA) that, if not met, results in the student being placed on academic probation. The student must then increase their subsequent year and average GPA to meet this minimum, otherwise risk academic suspension.  
The above paper uses data of students academic standing over the period of their studies to assess the effect of placing students who fail to meet a minimum academic standard on probation.  

The data includes a number of student characteristics (e.g. age, sex, high school grades, first language, birthplace) which are assessed to determine if any particular characteristic shows an increase in probability of a decision to leave or continue studying.   

The regression discontinuity model is used to perform the analysis as it can assess if there is a significant difference in the outcomes between the treatment group (those placed on academic suspension) and the control group (those not placed on academic suspension).  

The paper selected suggested that when students are placed on academic probation it can result in students not returning to university in the following year, and for those students who do return, an increase in their performance. _When the observable characteristics are assessed individually the results are consistent in that it also shows the probability of an increase in performance. _ 
  
The descriptive analyses replicated from the study are:  
- Statistical data of the observational data  

The inferential analyses replicated from the study are:  
- discontinuity of the frequency of students on probation in the first year. This analysis can identify if there is any grouping of data suggesting a non random sorting across the threshold.  
- assessment of the student characteristics to check for discontinuity between the treatment and control group. A discontinuity between these two groups suggests a particular characteristic may influence a students grade.  
- how being placed on academic probation impacts the subsequent years GPA (increase, decrease or no effect).  
_A number of figures associated with each of these analysis will also be replicated._  
The original report does not contain an assessment of linear regression assumption therefore these have been included with the assessment of discontinuity assumptions.  

The free roam section of this report looks at some of the characteristics not assessed as part of the original report to determine if if there is a difference in response to probation based on these characteristics, and if these characteristics further support or contradict the study findings.  
  
Most data cleaning had been performed by the original authors (removing students with missing data and those who did not have the academic standard assessed at the end of the first year). It was noted that there are discrepancies in the data range reported in the original study and the data available for review and replication. The report states academic standing data was collected in the years 1995 to 2004 however review of the reported first year confirmed the range of data supplied is 1996 to 2003.
```{r error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}

library(lmtest)
library(dplyr)
library(tinytex)
data_main <- read.dta("~/ECOM5002/Project/data.dta")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Summary  <-   list("First Year Data Range" =
       list("min"       = ~ min(firstyear),
            "max"       = ~ max(firstyear)))
Table1 <- summary_table(data_main, Summary)
kable(Table1, caption = 'Table 1')
```
This has resulted in the inability replicate the results exactly as per the original report.   

It was also noted that the original data had several points where students who did not meet the minimum GPA were not recorded as being placed on academic probation.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
data1 <- data_main[data_main$dist_from_cut > -1.4 & data_main$dist_from_cut < 1.4, ]# create threshold as per original report.
data_clean <- subset(data1, left_school==0)# to reduce bias for subsequent GPA analysis.
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data1, aes(dist_from_cut, probation_year1))+ geom_point()+geom_vline(xintercept = 0, col = "green")+ggtitle("Figure 1: Distribution of Data Around the Cutoff")+xlab("GPA Distance from Cutoff") + ylab("On Probation First year")
```

This data has been left in the analysis as we cannot confirm the accuracy of this data and therefore do not have sufficient justification  to remove it.  

## Descriptive Replication  
The data provided is based on GPA results from three different university campuses, one of which has a different cutoff GPA from the others. To allow for the use of all data based on the same cutoff point the original data includes an output variable of the students GPA distance from the specific campuses GPA cutoff. Using this value the cutoff point is set as 0. The data provided spans a bandwidth of 1.4 GPA points above and below the probation cutoff (0).  


Table 2 is the descriptive statistics for the data and replicates Table 1 in the original study. Results are similar to the original report descriptive statistics with male students representing 38% of the sample and 87% of students born in North America.

## Inferential Replication
### Testing for Regression Analysis Assumptions
In order to use a Linear Regression model the following assumptions have to be met:  
1. There is a linear relationship between the X and Y.  
2. The variance of the residuals are constant for all values of X.  
3. The error (residual) of one observation is independent of the error of another.  
4. For statistical inference, the residuals are normally distributed.  
As the assessment we are replicating uses a linear regression model to assess the impact of being put on probation to a students next GPA result, this data was assessed to confirm that it meets the above assumptions.   
```{r}
glm <- lm(nextGPA ~ gpalscutoff + gpaXgpalscutoff + gpaXgpagrcutoff+ gpasqXgpagrcutoff, data = data_clean)
plot(glm)
```

The residuals vs fitted values plot shows the data is distributed above and below the line however is noted that there is a decreasing trend in the data where more points are below the line as the X variable increases.  
The scale location plot suggest the residuals of the data do not have constant variance as the width of the data spread appears to increase as X increases.  
The the data below approximately -1 quantile on the Q-Q plot departs from the line therefore it cannot be assumed that the data is normally distributed.  
There are no significant outliers observed in the Residuals vs Leverage plot.

The above test of assumptions suggests the data does not fit well to a normal distribution and there is unequal variance in the residuals. There may be a more suitable model to use for this data or further transformations to improve the adherence to the required assumptions, however, the data will be used as is to perform the study replication.

### Testing for conditions of RDD  
The Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) model uses a continuous variable W (running variable) and assessed B1 close to the cutoff point c to assess for an approximation of the treatment affect. Value of W (in this study; the distance from cutoff) below c (in this study; the cutoff is 0) are the treatment group and values above c did not receive the treatment.  
$$
Y{i}=\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1X{i}+\hat{\beta}_2W{i}+u_i
$$
$$
Xi = \left\{\begin{array}{l} 1,\ \ \ \ Wi \ge c \\
0,\ \ \ \ Wi < c
\end{array}\right\}
$$
RDD measures the change in the probability at c (the discontinuity) and is used to estimate the effect of the treatment based on the size of the discontinuity at c.  
RDD requires that outputs close to the cutoff are continuous and do not group just above or below the cutoff, and, in the absence of treatment, the student would get the same GPA result. If grouping or a jump occurs at the cutoff, it suggests that the data is biased. In the current study this may occur if the students, knowing the GPA cutoff, manipulated their results to increase their GPA to just above the cutoff.  
The first year GPA results were chosen by the original report authors to reduce the likelihood of bias, as students are less likely to be aware of the GPA assessment and cutoff values in their first year of university.
As we do not have a sample of students who were not put on academic probation when below the cutoff to compare with, the frequency of the GPA results is used to assess if there is an observed jump at the cutoff. Figure 2 shows the regression of the frequency of the distance from cutoff values. The data is continuous through the cutoff point therefore there is no evidence of bias around the cutoff.   
Figure 2 replicates Figure 1 in the original report.  
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data1A <- data1 %>% 
  mutate(freq = 1)

# replace variable freq by quantity in each group of dist_from_cut_round10
data1A <- data1A%>% 
  group_by(dist_from_cut_med10) %>% 
  mutate(freq = length(freq))

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data1A %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = dist_from_cut_med10, y = freq)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color=data1A$dist_from_cut<0)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 3), se = FALSE)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) + 
  labs(y = "Frequency count", x = "GPA Distance from Cutoff", ggtitle("Figure 2: Distribution of Student GPAs"))
```

The observable characteristics were also assessed to determine if these variables are also continuous through the threshold. If any of the observations show significant discontinuity it is possible that a student with that characteristic is able to manipulate their grade to avoid being placed on academic probation.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
val_check = function(x)
{
  model = lm(x ~ gpalscutoff + gpaXgpalscutoff + gpaXgpagrcutoff+ gpasqXgpagrcutoff, data = data_clean)
  a = coeftest(model, vcov = vcovCL, cluster = data_clean$clustervar)
  c(a[2,1], a[2, 4], a[2, 2], a[1, 1], a[1, 4], a[1, 2])
}
myvars = c('hsgrade_pct', 'totcredits_year1', 'age_at_entry', 'male', 'english','bpl_north_america','loc_campus1', 'loc_campus2', 'loc_campus3')
chardata <- data_clean[myvars]
#colnames(abc) = c('gpa below cutoff 1', 'p-value 1', 'sd-error 1', 'intercept 0', 'p value 0', 'sd-error 1')
answer = lapply(chardata, val_check)
table3 = do.call(rbind.data.frame, answer)
colnames(table3) <- c('GPA below cutoff (1)', 'P-Value (1)', 'Std.err (1)','Intercept (0)', 'P-Value (0)', 'Std.err (0)')
rownames(table3) <- myvars
formattable(table3, 
            align =c("c","c","c","c","c", "c"), 
            list(`Indicator Name` = formatter(
              "span", style = ~ style(color = "grey",font.weight = "bold")),
              `P-Value (1)`= color_tile('pink', 'lightgreen')))
```
Table 3 above replicates Table 2 in the original report.  
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("C:/Users/Louise/OneDrive/Documents/ECOM5002/R data/Table 2.png"))
```

All results are not significant at the 10% level (all p-values are greater than 0.1) therefore there is no evidence of discontinuity at the cutoff for any of the observable characteristics.   
Assessment of the assumption that data is continuous through the threshold (and hence, not biased) is met.  

### Regression Discontinuity Design Analysis
#### Impact of Academic Probation on the next GPA result
The inferential data replicated is the impact of being placed on academic probation on the students subsequent GPA (of students who remain at university).  
Results were replicated using the polynomial linear regression equation stated in foot note 11 of the original report:  
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("C:/Users/Louise/OneDrive/Documents/ECOM5002/R data/equation.png"))
```
It is noted that in the original report the assessment of impact on the subsequent GPA may be biased due to the loss of students (dropping out) after the first year. The absence of second year results for these student can result in an increase in the probability of an improved GPA, as a number of students who would have a GPA below the cutoff in the second year if they had remained at university, are not longer included in the sample. Therefore students who have left school after the first year are removed from the dataset to reduce this bias.  
```{r}

```

```{r}
nextGPA_fn = function(x)
{
  model3 = lm(nextGPA ~ gpalscutoff + gpaXgpalscutoff + gpaXgpagrcutoff+gpasqXgpagrcutoff, data = x)
  a = coeftest(model3, vcov = vcovCL, cluster = x$clustervar) 
  c(a[2,1], a[2, 4], a[2, 2], a[1, 1], a[1, 4], a[1, 2])
}
myvars2 = c('All Data', 'HSgrade above Median','HSgrade below Median','Male','Female','Eng 1st language', 'Eng not 1st language')
colnames = c('gpa below cutoff 1', 'p-value 1', 'sd-error 1', 'intercept 0', 'p value 0', 'sd-error 1')
answer = lapply(Data_sets, nextGPA_fn)
table4 = do.call(rbind.data.frame, answer)
colnames(table4) <- c('GPA below cutoff (1)', 'P-Value (1)', 'Std.err (1)','Intercept (0)', 'P-Value (0)', 'Std.err (0)')
rownames(table4) <- myvars2
formattable(table4, 
            align =c("c","c","c","c","c", "c"), 
            list(`Indicator Name` = formatter(
              "span", style = ~ style(color = "grey",font.weight = "bold")),
              `P-Value (1)`= color_tile('pink', 'lightgreen')))
```
Results of the above table are compared to the first column of the first section of Table 6 (1.4 bandwidth, Control variable = no, No adjustment for students not returning), and Table 7 in the original report. Although results are not replicated exactly it still shows the probability of an improvement of the students subsequent GPA, calculated at 0.26 grade points (vs 0.19 grade points in the original report). All results are significant at the 1% level (p-values are less than 0.01).   
The subsequent GPAs for the different subgroups also showed and increase in the subsequent GPA as per the original report. Comparison of the groups shows the probability of improving the students subsequent GPA is greater in females than males, greater in students with high schools grades below the median than those above, and similar for those with English as their first language or not. It is noted that there is a difference in the native language results between the original report and this replication as the original report shows a greater difference in the increase in GPA between these two groups:  
Original report difference in increase in GPA = 0.039 points  
Replicated difference in increase in GPA = 0.005 points

## Critical Assessment
In replicating this report a number of issues and inconsistencies were encountered:
- Data provided for replication is not the same as the data used in the report. The number of input variable using bandwidth of $\pm$ 1.4 in the report is 32,697 whereas the number of input variable in the provided data when the bandwidth is $\pm$ 1.4 is 29,601. This was a results of the data provided having missing result for the years 1995 and 2004.  
- There is no confirmed assessment of linear regression assumptions in the original report, only RDD assumptions have been addressed. Our assessment of assumptions of linear regression suggests the data is not normally distributed and there is inconsistent variance in residuals with a pattern observed in both the Residuals vs Fitted plot and the Scale-Location plot. Therefore a linear regression may not be the best model for analysing this data.  
Because of these inconsistencies in the original report the data could not be replicated exactly.  

The replication of the next GPA results were chosen as this data is continuous output data which fits the requirements of a linear model. Other outputs assessed in the original report are the effect of probation on the decision to leave university, the effect of ever being suspended, and the effect on graduation. All of these outputs are binary therefore the authors have transformed these outputs to probabilities to create continuous data suitable for use in a linear regression model. Further research performed has found that a binary model can be used for regression discontinuity which may be more suitable for these  output types _https://github.com/honn-ishinn/RDD_academic_probation/blob/main/outputs/paper/paper.pdf_.  


_Further research of this study found a replication study of this original report  **reference**. Appendix 1 shows some of the replication of this report which does not use a quadratic term. Results of this report can be replicated exactly._ #cannot be used as does not adjust to a proportion for the binomial outputs.


## Free Roam
Data for the observable attributes of age and birthplace were not assessed as part of the original report. The free roam section of the report below assessed the impact of academic probation in the first year on the subsequent GPA based on the age of the student (when starting university) and the student birthplace (limited to North America or other).  
```{r}
Age_17 <- subset(data_clean, age_at_entry==17)
Age_18 <- subset(data_clean, age_at_entry==18)
Age_19 <- subset(data_clean, age_at_entry==19)
Age_20 <- subset(data_clean, age_at_entry==20)
Age_21 <- subset(data_clean, age_at_entry==21)

BP_NA <- subset(data_clean,bpl_north_america==1)
BP_other <- subset(data_clean,bpl_north_america==0)


Data_sets2 <- list(data_clean,Age_17,Age_18,Age_19,Age_20,Age_21, BP_NA,BP_other)

Sl_lv <- subset(data_clean, age_at_entry<=19)
mat_age <- subset(data_clean, age_at_entry>19)

Data_sets3 <- list(data_clean,Sl_lv, mat_age)
```

```{r}
FR_fn = function(x)
{
  model6 = lm(nextGPA ~ gpalscutoff + gpaXgpalscutoff + gpaXgpagrcutoff, data = x)
  a = coeftest(model6, vcov = vcovCL, cluster = x$clustervar) 
  c(a[2,1], a[2, 4], a[2, 2], a[1, 1], a[1, 4], a[1, 2])
}
myvars = c('All Data', 'Age entry = 17','Age entry = 18','Age entry = 19','Age entry = 20','Age entry = 21', 'Birth place Nth America', 'Birth place Other')
colnames = c('gpa below cutoff 1', 'p-value 1', 'sd-error 1', 'intercept 0', 'p value 0', 'sd-error 1')
answer2 = lapply(Data_sets2, FR_fn)
table5 = do.call(rbind.data.frame, answer2)
colnames(table5) <- c('GPA below cutoff (1)', 'P-Value (1)', 'Std.err (1)','Intercept (0)', 'P-Value (0)', 'Std.err (0)')
rownames(table5) <- myvars

formattable(table5, 
            align =c("c","c","c","c","c", "c"), 
            list(`Indicator Name` = formatter(
              "span", style = ~ style(color = "grey",font.weight = "bold")),
              `P-Value (1)`= color_tile('pink', 'lightgreen')))
```
All results show an increase in subsequent GPA results of 0.2 to 0.3 grade points at a minimum 10% significance. This is in agreement with the original paper that being put on probation increases the students probability of increasing their subsequent GPA (of those students that remain at university ).
