Data set: 
As attached (are we expected to provide the raw data?) 

 
What is being replicated: 
Regression discontinuity based on all students, sex, primary language and highschool grades.
Assess if being put on probreation in first year affects likelihood of being on probation in later years of study


 
Free roam: 
Split the data into above and below the cutoff and perform prediction on each to see if we can predict the student will or will not continue study
