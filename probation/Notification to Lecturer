Lindo, Jason M., Nicholas J. Sanders, and Philip Oreopoulos. 2010. "Ability, Gender, and Performance Standards: Evidence from Academic Probation." American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 2 (2): 95-117.DOI: 10.1257/app.2.2.95 
 

Data set: 
As attached (are we expected to provide the raw data?) 

 
What is being replicated: 
Regression discontinuity based on all students, sex, primary language and highschool grades.
Assess if being put on probreation in first year affects likelihood of being on probation in later years of study


 
Free roam Idea 1: 
Split the data into above and below the cutoff and perform prediction on each to see if we can predict the student will or will not continue study


Free roam Idea 2
We can do RDD only and estimate discontinuity for subgroups not included in the research paper. 
Right now, they are doing analysis for 6 subgroups. these are, men, women, native english speakers, non-native english speakers, Low HS grade and High HS Grade.

Ideas for making subgroups:

1. subgroups based on age. right now the age span is between 17-21. we can divide it into two groups of pre-teen (17-19) and post-teen (19-21).


2. Place of Birth (born in north America and otherwise)
